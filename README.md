# AMR-emosaics

This repository contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the plots from the paper "Linking globular cluster formation at low and high redshift through the age-metallicity relation in E-MOSAICS" (Horta et al 2020d, arXiv:https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201010522H/abstract). This work aimed to test if globular cluster (GC) formation at high and low redshift is universal by comparing the age-metallicity relation (AMR) of GCs in Large/Small Magellanic Cloud mass galaxies in the E-MOSAICS numerical cosmological simulations (Pfeffer et al 2018, Kruijssen et al 2018) to the AMR traced by an amalgamation of observational data of GCs in the LMC/SMC. 

In order to run the code and reproduce the plots, one must have access to the new suite of E-MOSAICS cosmological numerical simulations. The code runs in python (3+), assuming you have the following dependencies installed: astropy, matplotlib, numpy, tqdm, and dill.
