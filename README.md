# AMR-emosaics

This repository contains the scripts necessary to reproduce the plots from Horta et al 2020d. This work aimed to link globular cluster (GC) formation at high and low redshift through the age-metallicity relation (AMR) in E-MOSAICS (Pfeffer et al 2018, Kruijssen et al 2018). 

In order to run the code and reproduce the plots, one must have access to the new suite of E-MOSAICS cosmological numerical simulations. The code runs in python, assuming you have the following dependencies installed: astropy, matplotlib, numpy, tqdm, and dill.
